# Project Mansa: AI-Powered SPC for Human-Centric Quality Control



## üåç Making Technology Profoundly Human

**Project Mansa** is a flagship initiative of **Savoir Technologies**-**SVR**, driven by our mission: "Making technology profoundly human." In an era of increasing automation, we champion **Anthropic Alignment** ‚Äì the proactive design of AI to *enhance* human capabilities, agency, and flourishing, rather than diminish them through **Anthropic Redundancy**.

This project directly addresses the subtle erosion of human interpretative skills and problem-solving in industrial quality control, aiming to empower staff with deeper understanding and proactive management of processes.

## ‚ú® The Vision: Empowering Human Judgment with AI

Project Mansa is an **AI-powered Statistical Process Control (SPC) decision-support and training tool** for manufacturing and quality control. It's designed to help individuals, from novice technicians to seasoned engineers, understand, interpret, predict, and proactively manage process stability and quality.

**Key Differentiators & Our SVR Twist:**

* **Human-First AI:** We use AI to elevate human cognition and judgment, not replace it.
* **Accessibility:** Complex SPC concepts are made accessible and intuitive for all skill levels.
* **Training & Simulation:** Our unique AI-powered scenario builder generates realistic process data from natural language descriptions, enabling risk-free "what-if" analysis and robust training.
* **Future-Ready:** Built with architectural readiness for seamless integration with industrial hardware (IoT, sensors) in mind.

## üöÄ Current Status & Immediate Next Steps

Project Mansa is being developed incrementally. We've just completed a major milestone:

### Phase 1: Core SPC Charting Foundation (COMPLETE!)

We have a fully functional web-based X-bar Control Chart application. This includes:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript, Chart.js for interactive charts and user input.
* **Backend:** Python Flask for data handling and calculations, NumPy for statistical computations.
* **Core Functionality:** Users can input data, receive calculated X-bar chart parameters (sample means, overall mean, UCL, LCL), and visualize dynamic, styled charts.

### Phase 2: Intelligent Scenario Building (NEXT UP!)

Our immediate focus is to integrate the **Google Gemini API** to enable natural language-driven mock data generation. Users will be able to describe a process behavior (e.g., "a stable process with a sudden shift," "a slow upward drift"), and the AI will generate data to reflect that scenario on the X-bar chart for training and analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for rapid styling), JavaScript, Chart.js
* **Backend:** Python 3, Flask, NumPy
* **AI:** Google Gemini API, TextBlob (for basic NLP, as needed)

## üí° How to Get Started (Development)

This project is currently under active development. More detailed setup instructions will follow as we prepare for broader collaboration. For now, you'll need:

1.  Python 3.x installed.
2.  `pip` for package installation.
3.  A Google Gemini API key (for Phase 2 onwards).
